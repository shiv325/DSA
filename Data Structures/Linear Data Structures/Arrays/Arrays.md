# Arrays

- Linear Data Structure
- Collection of Elements of Same Variable Type
- Stores Elements at Contiguous Memory Locations (Indexes)
- Follows 0-Based Indexing i.e. first element has index 0
- Each element can be accessed via its index

# Why Arrays?

- Stores data for processing
- Implements data structures like Stacks and Queues
- Represent data in Tables and Matrices
- Create dynamic data structures like Linked Lists and Trees
