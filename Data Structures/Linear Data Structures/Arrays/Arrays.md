# Arrays

- Linear Data Structure
- Collection of Elements of Same Variable Type
- Stores Elements at Contiguous Memory Locations (Indexes)
- Follows 0-Based Indexing i.e. first element has index 0
- Each element can be accessed via its index

# Why Arrays?

- When the number of variables is very large to be stored and manipulated, we use arrays
- All the data is stored in one variable representing the array
- Each element has a position called index
- Each element can be accessed and manipulated via index

# Types of Arrays

1. `One-Dimensional Arrays` : Store single row of elements
2. `Multi-Dimensional Arrays` : Store multiple rows of elements

# Array Operations

1. `Traversal` : Access each element in a specific order
2. `Insertion` : Add an element at a specific index
3. `Deletion` : Delete an element at a specific index
4. `Searching` : Find index of specific element

# Advantages of Arrays

1. `Efficient Access To Elements` :
    - Provide direct and efficient access to elements
    - Accessing an element is O(1) operation i.e. time required to access an element is constant and doesn't depend on array size

2. `Fast Data Retrieval` :
    - Elements are stored at contiguous memory locations, so data can be accessed quickly and efficiently
    - No need of complex data structures or algorithms

3. `Memory Efficiency` :
    - Elements are stored at contiguous memory locations. So array size is known at compile-time
    - Memory can be allocated for entire array in 1 block, reducing fragmentation

4. `Versatality` :
    - Ability to store various data types like integers, floating-point numbers, characters, strings, pointers, objects, etc.

5. `Easy Implementation` :
    - Easy to use and understand
    
6. `Compatibility with Hardware` :
    - Compatible with most hardware architectures
 
# Applications of Arrays

- Stores data for processing
- Implements data structures like Stacks and Queues
- Represent data in Tables and Matrices
- Create dynamic data structures like Linked Lists and Trees
