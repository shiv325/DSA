# Data Structures

Data Structures are essential components which
  - Organize and store data efficiently in computer memory
  - Provides way to manage and manipulate data effectively
  - Enables faster access, insertion and deletion process
  - Defines relationship between data and operations that can be performed on data

# Why Data Structures?

1. `Efficient Data Management` :
    - Enables efficient storage and retrieval of data
    - Reduces processing time
    - Overall improves performance

2. `Data Organization` :
    - Organize data logically
    - Makes it easier to understand and access

3. `Data Abstraction` :
    - Hides implementation details of data storage
    - Allows programmers to focus on logical aspects of data manipulation

4. `Reusability` :
    - Common data structures can be reused in multiple applications
    - Saves time and effort in development

5. `Algorithm Optimization` :
    - Choice of appropriate data structure can significantly impact algorithm efficiency

# Types of Data Structures

1. `Linear Data Structures` :
    - Stores data sequentially
    - Allows easy insertion and deletion
    - Examples : Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, etc.

2. `Non-Linear Data Structures` :
    - Stores data in hierarchical or interconnected manner
    - Allows more complex relationships between data elements
    - Examples : Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, etc.

# Applications of Data Structures

1. `Database Management Systems` : Store and manage large amounts of structured data
2. `Operating Systems` : Manage memory, processes and files
3. `Compiler Design` : Represent source code and immediate code
4. `Artificial Intelligence` : Represent knowledge and perform reasoning
5. `Graphics and Multimedia` : Store and process images, videos and audio
