# Design and Analysis of Algorithms

- Involves creating efficient solutions to computational problems and evaluating their performance
- Ensure that the algorithms must address the specific challenges
- Analyse algorithms' efficiency in terms of `Time & Space Complexities` via `Complexity Analysis`

# Why Analysis of Algorithms?

- Focuses on `CPU (Time) Usage`, `Memory Usage`, `Disk Usage` and `Network Usage`
- All these are important
- But CPU (Time) is most important
