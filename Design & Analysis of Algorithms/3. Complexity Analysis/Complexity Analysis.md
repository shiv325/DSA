# Complexity Analysis

- Technique to characterize time taken by algorithm with respect to input size
- It's independent from machine, compiler and language
- Used to evaluate variations of execution time on different time

# Why Complexity Analysis?

- Determines amount of time and space resources needed to execute program
- Used to compare different algorithms on different input sizes
- Determines difficulty of problem

# How to Measure Complexity?

1. Time Complexity
2. Space Complexity
3. Auxiliary Space
