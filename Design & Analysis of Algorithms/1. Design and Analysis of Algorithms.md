# Design and Analysis of Algorithms

- Involves creating efficient solutions to computational problems and evaluating their performance
- Ensure that the algorithms must address the specific challenges
- Analyse algorithms' efficiency in terms of `Time & Space Complexities` via `Complexity Analysis`

# Why Design and Analysis of Algorithms?

- Focuses on `CPU (Time) Usage`, `Memory Usage`, `Disk Usage` and `Network Usage`
- All these are important
- But CPU (Time) is our main concern here

# Difference between `Performance` and `Complexity`

|             `Performance`             |                      `Complexity`                      |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
|   Time / Memory / Disk / etc. used    | Change in Resource Requirements of Program / Algorithm |
| Depends on machine, compiler and code |       Depends on size of problem solved by code        |

> _Note*_ : Complexity affects performance but not vice-versa
